## Exercise 1:
- Find the first even number each `row` in the `2D array` 
## Exercise 2:
- Find the total even number in the `2D array`
## Exercise 3:
- Find first positive number in each `row` in the `2D array`
## Exercise 4:
- Find the largest negative number
## Exercise 6:
- Check whether `2D array` contains negative number ?
## Exercise 7:
- Check if a column in the `matrix` is decreasing
## Exercise 8:
- Sum each `row` in the `2D array`
```
Sum of integers in row 0 is: 32
Sum of integers in row 1 is: -41
Sum of integers in row 2 is: 9
Sum of integers in row 3 is: 79
```
## Exercise 9:
- Calculate the sum of `odd values` in `each column`
```
Enter the number of rows: 
Enter a value > 1: 
2
Enter the number of columns:
Enter a value > 1: 
2
Array A values are: 
-43     40
-50     -43
Sum of integers in column 0 is: -43
Sum of integers in column 1 is: -43
```

## Exercise 10:
- Check if each row of the `2D array` contains `negative` numbers:
```
Row 0 contains negative numbers.
Row 1 does not contain negative numbers.
```
## Exercise 11:
- Check weather a matrix column is in ascending order
